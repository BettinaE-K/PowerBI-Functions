# PowerBI-Functions

Welcome to my store of useful functions and code.

Copy and paste the code in the .pq file into a blank query to duplicate this function in your solution.

Functions that can be performed in a single line as a direct step in the query (i.e. without invoking a function) are found in the .txt files.

Let me know if you find errors or have any questions.
